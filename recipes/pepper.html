  <h1>Roasted Red Pepper Soup</h1>
  <img class="peppero"src="../img/pepper2.jpg">

  <h2>Description</h2>
  <div class="container-miso-para pepper-para"><p>This roasted red pepper soup has a rich, thick and creamy consistency that you could eat it at room temperature during the summer months or nice and hot when the weather turns chilly.</p>
  <p>I never used to be keen on pepper sauces or soups because they always came out overly sweet to me but this red pepper soup has the perfect balance of sweet and tart flavours.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>

    <li>4 large red bell peppers</li>
    <li>1 medium yellow onion, peeled and diced (about 2 cup></li>
    <li>1 large russet potato, peeled and diced (about 1 1/2 cup)</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
    <li>1 quart chicken stock (or vegetable stock for vegetarian option)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup cream or milk</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>Cayenne, salt and pepper to taste</li>

  </ul>

  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <ol>

    <li><h4>Roast bell peppers until blackened all over:</h4>Roast the red bell peppers by placing them over or under an open flame until they blacken on all sides. (You can use a grill, cooktop gas burner, or oven broiler.) Place the blackened peppers in a bowl, cover the bowl with a plate, and let the peppers steam for 5 minutes, or until the skins feel like they can easily be slipped off. Remove the peppers from the bowl, peel off the blackened skins, remove the seeds. Chop the peppers roughly.
    </li>
    <li><h4>Sauté onions in butter: </h4>Heat the butter in a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally.
    </li>
    <li><h4>Add potatoes, garlic: </h4>Add the potatoes and cook another 1-2 minutes, then add the garlic and the chopped roasted peppers. Stir well and cook for 2 minutes
    </li>
    <li><h4>Add stock, simmer:</h4>Add the stock, stir well and bring to a simmer. Cook over medium heat until potatoes are soft, about 12 to 15 minutes. 
    </li>
    <li><h4>Purée soup: </h4>Purée the soup in a blender or food processor until very smooth. Fill the blender about halfway with the soup. Start the blender on low and keep your hand on the top, in case the lid wants to pop off from the rising steam. Once everything is well chopped, turn the blender to its highest setting and blend until smooth, about 1 minute. You might need to do this in batches.
    </li>
    <li><div class="bottom-spacer"><h4>Add cream, seasonings: </h4>Return to a clean pot set over low heat. Add the cream, stir well and taste. Add some cayenne, salt and pepper to taste.
