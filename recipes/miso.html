  <h1>Delicious Miso Soup</h1>
  <img class="misoo" src="../img/miso.jpg" alt="miso soup">

  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p class="para">Miso soup is a traditional Japanese soup often served as an appetizer at Japanese restaurants. In Japanese homes, it’s commonly served for breakfast with a bowl of rice and a simple protein like broiled fish.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>

    <li>2 tablespoons dried precut wakame seaweed </li>
    <li>1 (14x2 1/2-inch) piece of dried kelp (kombu) </li>
    <li>8 cups water </li>
    <li>2 cups (20g) large dried bonito flakes (katsuobushi), lightly packed </li>
    <li>1/3 cup white miso paste </li>
    <li>1 (16 ounce) package silken tofu, cut into 1-inch cubes </li>
    <li>2 teaspoons sesame oil </li>
    <li>1 scallion, thinly sliced </li>
    <li>1/8 teaspoon shichimi togarashi (optional) </li>
    <li>Steamed rice, to serve </li>

  </ul>

  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <ol>

    <li><h4>Rehydrate the wakame:</h4>
      Put the wakame into a medium bowl and cover with hot water. Let it rehydrate until it unfurls and softens, about 5 minutes. Drain the wakame, rinse with cold water, and squeeze it dry using your hands. The wakame will expand quite a bit so chop it into bite-size pieces and set it aside until ready to use.</li>
    <li><h4>Make the dashi:</h4>
      While the wakame is soaking, put the dried kelp and water into a 5 1/2-quart pot. Heat over medium heat until it’s just about to come to a simmer, 15 to 20 minutes. The kombu will have expanded quite a bit and the water should be pale yellow. Remove the kombu from the pot and discard it.</li>
    <li><h4>Add bonito flakes:</h4>
      Add the bonito flakes to the pot and bring it to a boil. Remove the pot from the heat. The flakes will float in a soggy layer on top of the water. Let the flakes sink to the bottom of the pot and let them steep for 15 minutes.</li>
    <li><h4>Strain the dashi: </h4>
      Set a fine mesh strainer over a large bowl or an 8-cup glass measuring cup. Pour the dashi through the strainer. You should have what looks like a golden broth. Discard the bonito flakes and rinse out the strainer, you’ll use it again. Wipe any residue from the pot and return the dashi to the pot.</li>
    <li ><div class="container-miso-para"><h4>Whisk in the miso: </h4>
      <p>Bring the dashi to a simmer over medium heat. Submerge the strainer into the dashi. Add the miso to the strainer submerged in the dashi and whisk to dissolve.</p>

      <p>Do not let the soup come to a boil. You can scrape the little bits of soybeans from the miso into the soup if you want.</p>
      
      <p>Alternatively, you can dissolve the miso with a fork in a small bowl or cup of the dashi and then pour it all back into the pot.</p></div></li>
    <li><h4>Finish the soup:</h4>
      Add the tofu and wakame to the soup and let them warm through, about 3 minutes. Drizzle the soup with sesame oil and garnish with scallions and togarashi.</li>
    <li><div class="bottom-spacer"><h4>Serve:</h4>
      Ladle the miso into bowls. Serve with the rice.</div></li>
